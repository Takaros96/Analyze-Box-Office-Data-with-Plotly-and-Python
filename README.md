In this project

1)Plotly was used to visualize the number of films per year

2)Number of films and revenue per year were visualized together in a graph

3)I arrived to the conclusion that release day of the film plays a significant role to its revenue

4)The films with the highest revenue had a runtime between 80 and 130 minutes
